Basketball, just like any sport or movement, is an ever evolving game with each season being different from the last. Being a huge basketball fan myself, I've followed basketball, specifically the Lakers, since 2004. To give a little more context as to how this project came about, this project was done around the time the NBA Finals was happening. Watching the games raised the question, is there a stylistic difference in the way basketball is being played in 2018 as compared to maybe 2010? I hypothesized that the high shooting style of the 2017 Defending Champions Golden State Warriors was going to be different compared to the half court game of the 2010 NBA Champions Los Angeles Lakers. Our group utilized Machine Learning methods to look at how well player statistics could be utilized to predict player positions and whether the current style of basketball had truly transitioned to positionless. 

## Methods
The positions were split into 2 sets of analyses: 
- 3 Position Analysis(Guard, Forward, Center)
- 5 Position Analysis(Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, Center)

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

## Conclusion
We can see that most of the Machine Learning algorithms have a harder time making accurate prediction for player statistics in 2018, which can indicate that the current style of basketball is more positionless as compared to 2010. For example, if you look at most centers and powerforwards, traditionally, their job is to play around the hoop, defending and rebounding, whereas guards and forwards play around the perimeter and the midrange. However, centers like Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis, now step out to the three point line to shoot three pointers. A player like Dwight Howard, who played in 2010, is still a traditional center who scores around the paint, defends, and rebounds. Although these traditional centers, such as Howard, still exist in the modern NBA, the introduction of new guard-like parameters in their playstyle makes it much more difficult to accurately predict position. From this, we can see that there is a signficant deviation from the traditional half court style of basketball that dominated the old school NBA and that a new era of basketball is in full effect.
